The specific experimental data from the two sets of experiments have been made publicly available. Exp1 consists of data collected at the East Annex of the Library at Beihang University, further divided into real-time collected datasets and later collected datasets. Exp2 consists of data collected at the New Main Building at Beihang University. Each dataset includes training and testing sets, with detailed data for each floor's corridors, staircases, and elevators. We welcome the use of these datasets for further discussion and collaboration!
